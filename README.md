`remote-test-refresh` is a leiningen plugin which uses SSH to synchronize code changes between local and remote machine automatically. When running, `remote-test-refresh` will scan code resources in the local project for changes. When detecting change, `remote-test-refresh` will transfer it per ssh and apply it to the remote repository.

In summary, `remote-test-refresh` offer possibilities:
   +  to synchronize code change between local and remote repository over ssh.
   +  to run command (.i.e start application, run tests) in the project on the remote machine and stream its output to local machine. 
   +  to forward port between remote and local machine. It's useful to test application interactively.
   
This picture illustrates how `remote-test-refresh` leverages the SSH for synchronization: 
   
```ruby

     |----Local Machine----|        remote-test-refresh        |----Remote Machine---|  
     |                     |     <----------SSH---------->     |                     | 
     | +--parent-folder    |      + transfer code change       | +--parent-folder    | 
     |    +-- project-1    |      + port forwarding            |   +-- project-1     | 
     |    +-- project-2    |      + run command remotely       |   +-- project-2     | 
     |---------------------|                                   |---------------------|  
	                                                       
```
  
   
To configure `remote-test-refresh`,  you can define `:remote-test` in your `.lein/profiles.clj` or in `project.clj` of the local project repository:

```clojure
:remote-test {:user              "your-ssh-user"                ;required for ssh connection
		      :host              "host-name-or-ip"              ;required for ssh connection
		      :with-system-agent true                           ;required for ssh connection 
	          :remote-path       "repo/parent/folder/on/remote" ;required for sync code change
	          :forwarding-port   9001                           ;optional for port forwarding
	          :command           "lein run"                     ;optional for running cmd
	          :notify-command    ["terminal-notifier" "-title"] ;optional for notification
	         }
```


`remote-path` specifies the  absolute path to the parent folder on remote machine. `remote-test-refresh` must know it, in order to apply code change to the remote repository correctly.

if `:remote-test` can not be found in the project.clj/profiles, `remote-test-refresh` will ask you all those parameters at the runtime. 

If `:with-system-agent` is set to false, `remote-test-refresh`  will use a separated ssh agent to connect to remote machine. In this case, `remote-test-refresh` will ask you for ssh authentication at the runtime.

#Notification

By defining `:notify-command` you will be notified every code change has been transferred successfully to remote machine. Currently it's tested for Mac OSX and Ubuntu.
  
On Mac:
   
     # install terminal-notifier
     $ brew install terminal-notifier

```clojure
:remote-test {:user "user"
              ...
              :notify-command  ["terminal-notifier" "-title" "Tests" "-message"]}
```

On Ubuntu:

     # install notify
     $ sudo apt-get install libnotify-bin

```clojure
:remote-test {:user "user"
              ...
              :notify-command  ["notify-send" "Tests"]}
```

#Usage

To start `remote-test-refresh` :

    $ lein remote-test-refresh
    * Remote-Test-Refresh version: 0.1.8
    
    * ==> Which command do you want to run on the repository of remote machine (optional): lein run  
    * ==> Enter port if you need a port to be forwarded (optional): 8080
    
    * Starting with the parameters: {:repo "repo", :user "user", :auth {:with-system-agent false, :password ***}, :host 1.2.3.4, :remote-path /folder/path/}
    * Starting session the parameters: {:username "user", :strict-host-key-checking :no, :password ***, :use-system-ssh-agent false}
    
    * Change has been transferred successfully
      Application starting ...
    ...


# Issues
If you have this problem under ubuntu when using system agent option:

     java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Unable to load library 'c': /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so: invalid ELF header
    
A solution could be:

    $ cd /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
    $ sudo ln -s libc.so.6 libc.so
